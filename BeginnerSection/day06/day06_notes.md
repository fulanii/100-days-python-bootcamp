```python
# ** Defining and calling python functions
    # python has a lot of built in funtion like len() print() range() etcc 
    # and we can make our function too !
    # to create our own fuction we start with 
		# the key word def (were defining our funtion)

Ex:
def my_fuction(): 
above im defining my function 
And even if i run the code nothing 
happens coz its a funtion 
and i need to call it to run the function

    print('yassine') # when the functions gets call it print these 2 lines
    print('issoufou')

my_fuction() # this is call and it execute the define funtion

** Indentation in  python 
	use 4 spaces when indenting insead of tap
	or set up in ide settings tab = to 
	4 spaces so u ger 4 spaces when u press tab

** While loops  in  python 

while loops:
        while a particular codition is true:
            do something repeatedly (it goes on till condition false)
            then do this
            then do this  

    for loops: 
    there's 2 type of for loops: for in range() and for loop itself
        for item in items_list:
            do something for each item
        for number in range(1, 10): 
            do something

An infinite is a loop that goes on forever usally a while loop 
EX: bellow
while 5 > 0: 
	print('yassine')
	this will go on forever coz 5 will always be > (great) than 0
