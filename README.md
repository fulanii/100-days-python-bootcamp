<p>
    I recently completed this Python bootcamp, this course was really helpful in taking me from an absolute beginner to a professional level. Throughout this comprehensive course i completed 100s of small project and dozens of real world prjects, I will also be completing a couple professional job resume/porfolio projects, lookout for them on my github. This repo will be use to post all my notes, to access later and share with others learning python.
